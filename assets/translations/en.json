  "zappr_description": "Zappr is a social network available on Android and iOS, which I co-founded with a friend and developed alone.\n\nZappr was initially a pure Android app written in Kotlin (and some Java) but later on I re-programmed it from scratch into what it is now: a Flutter app. It uses Firebase for authentication, notifications and deep links.\n\nI chose Python/Django for the backend, because I had previous knowledge of it and knew it could power an api. Instead of using Celery to manage my workers, I went with DjangoQ for an easy integration with Django. The app is deployed with uWSGI behind an Nginx proxy in a Kubernetes environment. The integrated chat is powered by Django Channels (websockets), deployed with Daphne.",
  "chat_ui_kit_description": "Chat Ui Kit is a published Flutter library that I wrote, because at the time no proper solution existed. The only package available was lacking core chat features such as support for groups, list conversations, typing events and more...\n\nSince I needed those features in Zappr, I decided to write this library which provides a complete tool set for developing a Flutter chat.",
  "portfolio_description": "There is currently no backend for this portfolio but I might add some feature that would require one in the future!\n\nUntil then, you can check out the code if you’re curious about some animations \uD83D\uDE0A.",

I also love hearing about other people’s passion so if you want to share or hire me, do drop me a message!"
